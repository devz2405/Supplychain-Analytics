# Supplychain-Analytics

## 🌟 **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: Supply Chain Profit Unlock**

This project analyzed **180,000+** global orders to diagnose logistics inefficiencies and unlock hidden revenue.

* **Problem:** 46% of potential revenue is stuck in **Pending/Process** orders, and chronic delays exist in 15+ countries.
* **Solution:** Developed a BI dashboard identifying operational bottlenecks (e.g., Second Class shipping) and sub-optimal transaction processing.
* **Impact:** Provided **actionable recommendations** to recover high-risk revenue, focus sales on high-margin hotspots (e.g., Germany, Australia), and implement **segmented, data-driven pricing** for sustained profit growth.

### ⚡ **KEY ANALYTICS JOURNEY HIGHLIGHTS**

#### *1. Shipping & Delivery Performance*

* **Chronic Delays:** Identified **15+ countries** (e.g., Luxembourg, South Sudan) with consistent $>1$ day shipping delays, indicating a clear operational bottleneck.
* **Mode Reliability:** **Standard Class** is the most reliable mode. **Second Class** is the slowest, longest customer wait.
* **Business Impact:** Delayed regions correlate with **risky, sporadic revenue** and high customer dissatisfaction.
  On-time shipping improves repeat sales and satisfaction

#### *2. Product Profitability & Discounting*

* **Pricing Strategy:** **Larger discounts** directly lead to lower overall profit, despite higher sales volume. *Avoid blanket discounting.*
* **High-Margin Products:** Electronics and Fitness categories drive **"fewer, bigger wins."**
* **Growth Drivers:** Sports gear, Fan Shop, and Apparel drive **top-line revenue**, irrespective of shipping delays.

#### *3. Regional Profitability Hotspots* 🌍🔥

| Metric | Top Markets (Sales Volume) | Top Hotspots (Sales & Margin) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Global** | Europe, Latin America | **Germany, Australia, Argentina, Saudi Arabia** |
| **State-Level** | U.S. (dominant), Puerto Rico, Michigan, Alabama | *(Focus on State/Region Segmentation for targeted logistics)* |

#### *4. Operational Efficiency: Revenue at Risk*

* **Critical Metric:** Only **33%** of total order value reaches the **“complete”** status.
* **Major Opportunity:** **46% of potential revenue** is currently *at risk* due to **Pending, Canceled, or Processing** delays.
    * **Conversion Rate:** $\approx$ 33%
    * **Cancellation Loss:** $\approx$ 2%
    * **Pending/Process Risk:** **$\approx$ 46% of Revenue** (The biggest unlock opportunity).

#### 5. **Customer Insights**
* Customer base is **well-diversified**; no one segment (consumer/corporate/home office) dominates
* **Segmentation by region/state** enables targeted improvements and custom logistics solutions

### 🎯 **KEY RESULTS & ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS**

1.  **Operation Fix:** **Target bottleneck countries/modes** (e.g., Second Class shipping) to unlock the **46% "stuck revenue"** opportunity.
2.  **Pricing Strategy:** Eliminate blanket discounting. Implement **data-driven, segmented pricing** to maximize profit per unit.
3.  **Targeted Logistics:** Use **segmentation** (by Region, Product, Customer Type) to implement **custom logistics solutions** and focused marketing efforts.
4.  **Monitoring:** Immediately monitor and drill down on all **Pending/Process Orders** to mitigate revenue loss.
