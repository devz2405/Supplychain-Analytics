# Supplychain-Analytics

Supply Chain Logistics Analytics: From Raw Data to Actionable Insights
🚀 Project Objective
Purpose:
To empower decision-makers in logistics and operations with clear data-driven insights into shipping performance, product profitability, geographic sales trends, and customer segmentation, unlocking efficiency gains and profit growth across a complex global supply chain.

📦 Dataset Overview
Source: Kaggle - Dataco Smart Supply Chain Big Data

Contents: Granular order-level records including shipping, product, geography, customer, and operational status for ~180,000 transactions, 45 columns

Scope: Data spans multiple regions, product lines, and shipping channels

🔍 Project Workflow
1. Rigorous Data Preparation

Normalized columns, handled missing/duplicated/erroneous entries

Feature engineering: shipping delays, profit calculations, order/shipping periods

Consistent data types across dimensions (dates, numerics, categoricals)

2. Exploratory Data Analysis & KPI Development

Uncovered operational bottlenecks and revenue-at-risk by parsing all order statuses

Segmented sales and profit by market, customer segment, product family, and geography

3. Advanced Visualization and Dashboarding

Built actionable visualizations (bar, scatter, heatmap, geospatial views)

Developed ready-to-use dashboards (Power BI) for management

💡 Key Insights & Business Findings
Shipping & Delivery:

Identified 15+ "bottleneck" countries with chronic >1 day order delays (Luxembourg, South Sudan, etc.)

Standard Class shipping most reliable; Second Class lags far behind in speed

Operations:

Only 33% of all order value reaches "complete"—the rest is either pending or at risk due to fulfillment delays

Revenue at risk from pending/processing/canceled orders approaches 46%

Profitability:

Sales and margin leadership comes from electronics, fitness, and branded apparel, despite logistic differences

Deeper discounting can raise volume but erodes overall profitability; data-driven pricing is essential

Market & Customer Trends:

Europe and Latin America are top markets by sales, with diversified customer base (no single segment dominance)

U.S. states like Alabama and customer clusters in Puerto Rico/Michigan are volume leaders

📊 Solution Overview (Technical Stack)
Python: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly (data wrangling + visualization)

Jupyter Notebooks: for code, EDA, and reporting

Power BI: analytics dashboard


📢  Recommendations:
Prioritize operational fixes in bottleneck countries and shipping modes

Institute data-driven discounting policy: balance profit and order volume

Regularly monitor "revenue at-risk" and address fulfillment/process delays

Use customer segmentation results for precision targeting and tailored logistics
